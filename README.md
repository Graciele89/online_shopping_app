## Introduction
This app is a final project for the first semester in Mobile application using Android Studio and Kotlin language. We were required to create an online shopping app, using consuming JSON API hosted in https://fakestoreapi.com. 

## Difficulties | challenges
The biggest challenge was work in a such heavy Integrated Development Environment (IDE), as my laptop only have 8GB,Android Studio keept crashing all the time, in the task manager you could see 100% of CPU utilization,  and  every change I did I had to keep waiting ages till it applies, also connect everything throug Firebase was long work, only the first part took me more than five full days to make it work, and I watched so many different tutorials to try understand and while following steps, I got so many errors, and other problem is that they changing and updating the system every day, is hard to find anything up to date enough that works.
